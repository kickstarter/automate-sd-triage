# Remediation Catalog

Durable reference mapping CHECK support-dev ticket symptoms to known manual remediations. Consulted by
the `check-remediation` skill. Keep it current as support tasks and Guru runbooks change.

**Two systems, two consoles.** Remediations run against either the **rosie** or the **kickstarter**
support-task library, each in its own production console. Every entry below is tagged with its
`system`. The skill opens the console named by the tag — it never infers which system a task belongs
to. Confirm a task's branch/path at runtime before relying on a `require_relative` — **if the task
isn't on `main`, a production console can't `require_relative` it at all**, since production checks
out `main` (see "Prototype working branches" below).

> ## Source of truth
>
> The **living `main` of the kickstarter and rosie GitHub repos is the authoritative list of which
> support tasks exist.** Verify availability there at runtime (e.g. `gh api`/`gh search code`, or
> `git fetch && git ls-tree origin/main -- lib/support_tasks/`) rather than trusting this file to be
> complete. **The task tables below are curated examples** — the common remediations and the
> symptom→task mapping — not an exhaustive or always-current inventory. A task that isn't on `main`
> (e.g. the rosie PLOT tasks) is a prototype on a working branch, not a generally-available task.

## ID conventions (READ FIRST — easy to get wrong)

**All ids in `kickstarter.com` admin URLs are _kickstarter_ ids, not rosie.** A `/admin/pledges/<id>`
id is a **kickstarter backing id**, not a rosie `Pledge` primary key.

- **kickstarter console** operates on kickstarter ids directly: `Backing.find(<backing id from URL>)`.
- **rosie console** operates on rosie `Pledge` ids — resolve from the kickstarter backing id:

  ```ruby
  pledge = Pledge.find_by(client_id: 1, foreign_key: <backing id from admin URL>)  # client_id = 1 in prod
  # pass pledge.id to rosie support tasks that expect a rosie pledge_id
  ```

- Reverse (rosie → kickstarter): `pledge.foreign_key` is the kickstarter backing id; `Backing.find(it)`
  in a kickstarter console.
- Per-increment commands need the `PaymentIncrement` id, read off the pledge inspect page — it is NOT
  in the URL.

Label which id is which (kickstarter backing id vs rosie pledge id vs Stripe PI) in every snippet.

## Consoles

| System | Open with | Loads tasks from |
|---|---|---|
| rosie | `cd rosie && ksr console production` (PRODUCTION — `exit` when done) | `rosie/lib/support_tasks/` |
| kickstarter | kickstarter production Rails console | `kickstarter/lib/support_tasks/` |

rosie console service objects on `main` are loaded with `require_relative` and exist only for the
session. **Not every task defaults to `dry_run: true`** — `RefundDuplicateCharge` has no `dry_run` at
all and runs live immediately; check each task's actual signature rather than assuming the pattern
holds.

## rosie support tasks — `system: rosie` (examples — verify against live `main`)

| Service object | File | Branch | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SyncIncrementalPledgeToStripe` | `lib/support_tasks/sync_incremental_pledge_to_stripe.rb` | `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply` | Reconcile a PLOT pledge's increment / funds-capture / pledge state against the authoritative Stripe PaymentIntent. Flips `errored → collected`, un-cancels later increments, re-marks pledge, re-schedules collection. Entry: `.perform(pledge_id:, dry_run: true)`. |
| `RefundPaymentIncrementFromKsr` | `lib/support_tasks/refund_payment_increment_from_ksr.rb` | `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply` | Refund a single increment, cost borne by KSR. |
| `RefundIncrementFromProjectPaymentSource` | `lib/support_tasks/refund_increment_from_project_payment_source.rb` | `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply` | Refund remaining collectible from the creator's card. |
| `RefundIncrementFromDepositAccount` | `lib/support_tasks/refund_increment_from_deposit_account.rb` | `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply` | Refund from the creator's Stripe connected account. |
| `ReactivatePledgeFromPledgedBacking` | `lib/support_tasks/reactivate_pledge_from_pledged_backing.rb` | `main` | (Draft, untested) Reactivate a pledge from a known-good backing's payment source (shared-pledge / double-charge). |
| `RefundDuplicateCharge` | `lib/support_tasks/refund_duplicate_charge.rb` | `main` | Refunds the orphaned duplicate Stripe PaymentIntent left behind when a backer retries fixing a card that needs 3DS authentication after the project has succeeded. Finds all successful PIs on the pledge and refunds the one with a nil `intendable_id`. Entry: `.perform(ksr_backing_id:, client_id: nil)` — **no `dry_run` flag; refunds immediately.** Added 2026-07-01 (previously uncataloged — found while investigating CHECK-306). |

> The PLOT-sync/refund tasks (`SyncIncrementalPledgeToStripe`, `RefundPaymentIncrementFromKsr`,
> `RefundIncrementFromProjectPaymentSource`, `RefundIncrementFromDepositAccount`) are **not on `main`**
> yet — they live on the working branch `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply`, which is their prototype branch
> (see "Prototype working branches"). `RefundDuplicateCharge` is a separate, older task and has always
> been on `main`.
>
> **Test coverage as of 2026-07-01:** `SyncIncrementalPledgeToStripe` and `RefundDuplicateCharge` have
> specs (`spec/lib/support_tasks/`). `RefundPaymentIncrementFromKsr`,
> `RefundIncrementFromProjectPaymentSource`, and `RefundIncrementFromDepositAccount` had none — tests
> for those three are being added on `demo/plot-refund-tasks-tests` (branched from
> `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply`).

## kickstarter support tasks — `system: kickstarter` (examples — verify against live `main`)

Run in the kickstarter production console; operate on **kickstarter** ids (`Backing`, etc.).

| Service object | File | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ResyncBackingWithPledge` | `lib/support_tasks/resync_backing_with_pledge.rb` | "Unsettled Backings": syncs backing status from the rosie pledge state. Only two branches exist: `Rosie::Pledge::COLLECTED` → `Backing::STATE_COLLECTED`; `Rosie::Pledge::INACTIVE` → `Backing::STATE_DROPPED`. `.call(admin_id:, backing_id:)`. **Gap (confirmed against `origin/main` 2026-07-01): no branch for `ACTIVE` or `COLLECTING` (ongoing/mid-cycle PLOT) — silently no-ops**, doesn't raise — anything that isn't `COLLECTED`/`INACTIVE` falls straight through. For that case, use the Guru "PLOT Retry/Resurrect" card's resync pattern instead of a bare manual write — it derives `Backing` status from `backing.rosie_pledge.state` across `ACTIVE`/`COLLECTING` → `STATE_PLEDGED` and `COLLECTED` → `STATE_COLLECTED`, with an implicit no-op else. Use `update!` (not `update_column`) so `pledged_at`-setting and other status-transition callbacks still fire. |
| `FixOrphanedBacking` | `lib/support_tasks/fix_orphaned_backing.rb` | Rosie pledge `active` but KSR backing stuck in pre-auth ($0, no `pledge_key`) after a failed checkout signal. `.new(backing_id:, project_id:, pledge_id:, payment_source_id:).call`. |
| `DropErroredPledges` | `lib/support_tasks/drop_errored_pledges.rb` | Drop errored pledges (often fraudulent). `.batch_run(admin_id:, backing_ids:, state_reason: nil)`. |
| `SyncRefundCheckout` | `lib/support_tasks/sync_refund_checkout.rb` | Sync a `RefundCheckout` to a successful `Rosie::Refund` (legacy 3DS-delayed refunds). `.call(refund_checkout:, rosie_refund:)`. |

> Earlier drafts mis-filed `ResyncBackingWithPledge` as a rosie task — it is **kickstarter**.
>
> **`ResyncBackingWithPledge` gap (CHECK-306 follow-up, sharpened 2026-07-01):** don't reach for this
> task when a ticket needs a backing to reflect an *ongoing* PLOT pledge — it only covers a rosie pledge
> that's reached `COLLECTED` or `INACTIVE`, and silently no-ops for **both `ACTIVE` and `COLLECTING`**
> (any other state falls through with no branch, not just `ACTIVE`). Use the Guru "PLOT Retry/Resurrect"
> card's `case backing.rosie_pledge.state` pattern instead of a bare manual write (see table row above)
> — same idea, but it also covers `COLLECTED` and is a citable runbook rather than an invented snippet.
> Worth a small patch to add the missing branches to the task itself; flagged, not yet done.

**Search Guru directly whenever the matched row above feels generic or approximate for the ticket's
specific symptom — not only when nothing is listed at all.** This table is a curated subset of Guru's
runbooks, not a mirror of it; a more targeted card can exist even for an already-cataloged symptom
class (CHECK-304: this catalog's own "Troubleshooting PLOT collections" row was a plausible match, but
Guru's "PLOT Retry/Resurrect" card — added below only after the fact — was the one that actually fit
the ticket's dropped-pledge symptom). Don't stop at the first plausible catalog row.

## Symptom → remediation map

| Symptom (from ticket / CS) | Likely class | System | First move |
|---|---|---|---|
| Increment shows `errored` but Stripe shows the charge `succeeded` | State drift | rosie | `SyncIncrementalPledgeToStripe` (dry-run → live) after confirming PI `succeeded` in-console |
| Backer has 2+ successful Stripe PaymentIntents **confirmed against the same increment/installment** (retried a 3DS-required card fix after project success) | Duplicate charge | rosie | `RefundDuplicateCharge.perform(ksr_backing_id:)` — no dry-run; manually preview via `pledge.payment_intents.where.not(succeeded_at: nil)` first (see "ID conventions" / task table above) |
| PLOT errored, **no payment attempts found** | Collection never ran — branches on `pledge.state`, see lesson below | rosie | `state == "inactive"` (dropped, dibs released): PLOT Retry/Resurrect path — reactivate (`state: Pledge::COLLECTING` raw write) → `Pledges::Update` (redib) → `PaymentIncrements::CollectPaymentIncrement`. `"active"`/`"collecting"` already: `PaymentIncrements::CollectPaymentIncrement` directly. Increments don't exist yet: `Pledges::Collect.call` or re-drive `IncrementalPledgeCollectionJob` |
| Blank/empty dialog or red box fixing an errored PLOT pledge | UI symptom; state varies | rosie | Dry-run sync to diagnose: succeeded → sync; healthy-not-succeeded → re-drive |
| Backer can't collect; Stripe capabilities **suspended** | Not an SD fix | — | Tag Trust & Safety (payments) — STOP |
| Backing active but pledge inactive, or pledge collected but backing didn't get the signal; collection blocked | Backing↔pledge drift | kickstarter | `ResyncBackingWithPledge` (Unsettled Backings / CollectionBlocked) — only covers rosie pledge `COLLECTED`/`INACTIVE` |
| Kickstarter backing needs to reflect an ongoing PLOT pledge (rosie pledge `ACTIVE` or `COLLECTING`) after a rosie-side fix | Backing↔pledge drift, ongoing PLOT | kickstarter | `ResyncBackingWithPledge` doesn't cover these states (silently no-ops) — use the PLOT Retry/Resurrect card's `case backing.rosie_pledge.state` pattern (`ACTIVE`/`COLLECTING` → `STATE_PLEDGED`) |
| Rosie pledge active, KSR backing stuck pre-auth ($0, no pledge_key) | Orphaned backing | kickstarter | `FixOrphanedBacking` |
| Errored / likely-fraudulent pledges to drop | Drop errored | kickstarter | `DropErroredPledges.batch_run` |
| RefundCheckout not matching a successful rosie refund (legacy 3DS) | Refund sync | kickstarter | `SyncRefundCheckout` |
| PM order stuck / voucher not applied / data stale | PM order needs refresh | — (admin UI) | Admin **Refresh order** (per-order; see blast-radius note) |
| Email/template rendering bug (e.g. Outlook dark mode) | Code fix, not data | — | No console remediation; route to engineering |

When the class is ambiguous, say so and lead with a diagnostic dry-run rather than a state change.

**Duplicate-charge vs. state-drift lesson (CHECK-306, learned the hard way):** "2 successful Stripe
charges" on a pledge is NOT by itself evidence of a duplicate charge — it can just as easily be two
unrelated increments that both legitimately succeeded, with one of them drifted out of sync locally.
CS/Rovo auto-triage framing ("backer appears double-charged") is a hypothesis, not a confirmed fact —
weigh the ticket's own description over triage comments when they disagree. Don't classify duplicate
vs. drift from amount/date pattern-matching alone: `SyncIncrementalPledgeToStripe`'s dry-run resolves
which Stripe PI is actually linked to which increment (via the increment's own `funds_capture`/
collection record) without guessing, so when in doubt, run that dry-run first — it's non-destructive
and will surface a genuine duplicate too (two PIs mapped to the same increment). Reach for
`RefundDuplicateCharge` only once a duplicate against the *same* increment is confirmed, not inferred.

**Collection-never-ran diagnosis lesson (CHECK-304):** "no payment attempts found" has more than one
root cause, and the fix branches on `pledge.state` — which the original CHECK-304 remediation never
actually inspected (it printed `active_dibs` and `payment_increments`, but not the pledge's own state
column). An `INACTIVE` pledge already had its dibs released by the `deactivate` transition's
`after_transition` callback — that's a **dropped** pledge, not a "stuck" one, and it needs the PLOT
Retry/Resurrect reactivation sequence before any collection attempt can work at all. This is a hard
guard, not a style preference: `PaymentIncrements::CollectPaymentIncrement` raises unless
`pledge.state == Pledge::COLLECTING`, and `Pledges::Update` raises `Rosie::PledgeLocked` if
`pledge.inactive?` — so the reactivating write has to happen first, in that order. Always print
`pledge.state` in the inspection step for this symptom class, not just dibs/increments.

**Required-input lesson (CHECK-304):** a redib/payment-source-reassignment fix (PLOT Retry/Resurrect)
needs one thing no console query can produce: **which saved card the backer wants used.** The Guru card
lists this as an explicit prerequisite; don't bury it as an inline comment on a `target_last4 = ...`
placeholder line the way the first draft of this remediation did — name it as a requirement up front.
It doesn't always mean a fresh round-trip to the backer: on CHECK-304 it was inferred from the Zendesk
ticket text plus the customer's recent Stripe activity rather than asked fresh. Either way, state in the
write-up whether the value is *confirmed* (backer said so) or *inferred* (from context) — the human
running the snippet needs to know which, since a wrong card selection here reattempts a real charge.

## Diagnosis via Looker (read-only — do this before opening a console)

Diagnose and confirm scope in Looker, not a production console. Useful explores:

- `rosie_payment_increments` — `state`, `state_reason`, `scheduled_collection` per increment.
- `rosie_pledges`, `rosie_payment_intents`, `funds_captures` — pledge/PI/capture state.
- `rosie_errored_pledges_over_time` — `is_collected` / `is_dropped` / `is_success_present` /
  `number_of_errors` by project/backer; affected-scope counts.
- `cs.model` — Zendesk ↔ backings/projects/users for cohort overlap.

**Looker lags production.** The authoritative just-before-write check (e.g. "is this Stripe PI
`succeeded` right now?") is taken in-console/Stripe immediately before the dry-run — never from Looker.

---

## Standard pre-flight for any PLOT state change

1. **Rule out suspended Stripe capabilities** (project admin → Rosie deposit account → Connect
   dashboard → capabilities). Suspended → STOP, tag T&S.
2. **Confirm the Stripe PI state** for the increment (in-console, not Looker):
   ```ruby
   payment_increment = PaymentIncrement.find(<INCREMENT_ID from pledge inspect>)
   payment_increment.funds_capture.stripe_payment_intent   # expect "succeeded" for a sync
   ```
3. **Always dry-run first.** Read the report before re-running with `dry_run: false`.

---

## Prototype working branches (link code from the Jira comment)

A remediation is backed by **code**, not just an inline snippet:

- **Existing task, used as-is** → link to it at its current branch/path (e.g. the rosie PLOT tasks on
  `demo/stripe-sync-plan-apply`); inline the call in the comment. **If that branch isn't `main`, say so
  in the snippet and don't write a bare `require_relative`** — a production console checks out `main`,
  so the file genuinely isn't there. Instruct copying the class body from the linked branch and pasting
  it directly into the console session to define it for that session, then calling `.perform`. (Learned
  the hard way on CHECK-303/CHECK-306/CHECK-250: the first drafts used a bare `require_relative` that
  would have failed against a real production checkout.)
- **Would modify an on-`main` task, or warrant a new task file** → open a **working branch** in the
  relevant repo (rosie or kickstarter per the system tag) holding the prototype, so the team can
  examine and test it with one-off remediations. **Confirm before pushing** the branch to origin
  (pushing is outward-facing); then include the link.

The Jira comment carries **both** the prototype link(s) **and** the runnable code blocks. For a task
already on `main`, a plain `require_relative` in the console works as normal. For a prototype-branch
task, the code block instead needs the full class body pasted inline (paste-into-console), since
`require_relative` has nothing to load from in production. Prototype code is for review and testing;
production runs remain human-only and dry-run-first. Promotion to `main` is ordinary PR review, outside
this toolkit.

---

## Admin-action blast-radius lesson (learned the hard way)

Before worrying that an admin button changed something project-wide, **trace what it actually writes.**
The **"Allow auto-exempt backers to re-enter PM checkout"** checkbox on the order admin page
(`engines/pledge_redemption/app/views/pledge_redemption/admin/orders/show.html.haml`) is the
`reset_must_acknowledges` field of the per-order **Refresh Order** form. Its controller
(`pledge_redemption/admin/orders_controller.rb#refresh`) calls `PR::RefreshOrder.call(order:, ...)`
under a per-row lock and sets `must_acknowledge_*` on **that single order** only. It writes **no**
project or `pledge_manager` record. The label sounds project-wide; the effect is one order.

General rule: the pledge-manager / orders domain lives in the `engines/pledge_redemption/` Rails engine
inside the kickstarter repo. When asked "did I change something project-wide?", grep the engine, trace
form field → controller action → service, and confirm the scope of the writes before speculating.
